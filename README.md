# Detection Lab

## Objective
This Detection Lab project focuses on using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to ingest and analyze logs from various sources in a controlled environment. This project focuses on creating telemetry to detect, investigate, and respond to security events in real time. By configuring log sources, and developing custom parsing rules, This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps
I started by installing Sysmon on my windows 11 VM. Sysmon is a Windows tool that generates telemetry on system activity to help with threat detection and monitoring.
